# About-Me
Hello my name is Aidan Caldararo and I am currently attending Kennesaw State University as a cybersecurity major. Outside of my school I also attended a course to learn more about Data Science with Python and SQL. To further my education in that field I've started attending a course with University of California Berkeley for ML / AI. 

##What I've Done
### For class
In school I've done a variety of activities involving cybersecurity
- Policy and Governance
- - I reviewed and revised an existing policy and governance document created by a madeup company. The original document was compiled into one big paper, part of my task while revising was to recreate this document as a more managable and compact document. This consisted of uploading the different policies to a cloud and linking them all together into a table of contents.
- Harden Servers
- - I researched and put into practice various hardening methods using both Linux and Windows servers. These practices were for services such as http, DNS, POP3S, SMTPS, and SSH
